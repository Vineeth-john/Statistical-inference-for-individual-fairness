# Statistical inference for individual fairness in machine learning models

### Overview 
This project aims to explore and mitigate gender bias in the UCI Adult Dataset using various techniques from the fields of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation. By identifying and addressing biases in the dataset, we strive to develop machine learning models that are fair, unbiased, and capable of making equitable predictions across gender groups.


### Dataset
The UCI Adult Dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset, contains demographic information such as age, education, occupation, and gender, among others. However, like many real-world datasets, it may exhibit biases that can influence the performance of machine learning models trained on it.


### Model Trainning 
For the purpose of this project a multilayer perceptron (MLP). A multilayer perceptron is a type of feedforward neural network consisting of fully connected neurons with a nonlinear kind of activation function.
